### Walking Synthesizer ###

This is an Android app for playing and generating music while walking.
It keeps track of the leg movement pace and plays music based on that.
It counts the steps quite precisely, so this could also serve as pedometer.

## Features ##
* Mobile device's accelerometer
* Csound library - [Csound GitHub](https://csound.github.io/)
* Achartengine

This is my personal software project created with passion to the music. I explored the depths of csound language, which seems to be very poweful.
